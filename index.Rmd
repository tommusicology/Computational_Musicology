<h1>Welcome to my portfolio for Computational Musicology.</h1>

Imagine a standing a front a contruction site, where they 'hammer' and 'bonk' on a ryhtm. Take a moment to hear how that would sound.

You have just experienced how most people experience [hardcore house](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcore_house) music, often reffered to as **harder styles music**. This specific kind of EDM is by most people described as _loud-_, _predominant music_ or _just noize_. One could say that due to the intensity of the sound it's not the most popular genre. Although the're a number of large festivals in The Netherlands dedicated to unique music, some you may know; Thunderdome, Defqon.1, Dominator, Free Festival and Qlimax. 

Usually harder styles music is referred to _hardstyle_, _hardcore_ or _gabber_ but the terms are used haphazerdly. To the annoyance of many true fans of the genre, because the style of music offers many styles with different characteristics. For example by tempo, melody and energy of the tracks. But the styles evolve and influence eachother over time. Thus it could be difficult to determine how a style truly is defined. Spotify doesn't distinguish between the styles yet (all harder styles tracks are found under EDM) and admittedly sometimes the line between the subgenres is a bit arbitrary. But by only hearing a song it's possible to recognize it's style and even artist. Also, Spotify is able to do that too! As the algorithm is able to recommend harder styles songs. One could argue there is an objective basis to be defined to order the harder styles tracks into subgenres. This course would be a great moment to find that out.

In my portfolio I am going to try and establish a **profile** for some of the most recognized harder styles in the community. In two ways this will be done. I'll be comparing harder styles music with other Western music styles and with other subgenres. Using the hardstyle wiki I'll look at characteristics of these genres and see whether these hold up. There genres that are considered in this portfolio are; [happy hardcore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWJEM5Vcxmk), [euphoric hardstyle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVMSEaXUpcU), [raw hardstyle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coQbQL_1gsg), [mainstream hardcore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rkx_OpJBks), [industrial hardcore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDgRRTz1piw) and where things get really crazy; [uptempo hardcore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS8qiTp3ybU). 

The different genres are discussed in the harder styles catalogue. Also some honorable mentions are added. The page colors correspond to the [color of the respective Defqon.1 festival stages](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardstyle/comments/7mddmz/color_meaning_of_the_stages_in_defqon1/) where these respective genres are played (except pink which I just found a suitable color for happy hardcore).

The second page is harder styles compared to other music. On the third page are subgenres considered apart from one another and this is summarized on the last page.

```


```{r}

combi_loudness <- ggplot(combi) +
  geom_violin(aes(category, loudness, fill = category))+
    labs(x = 'Genre', y = 'Loudness') +
    ggtitle('Loudness - music styles') +
  theme_hard; combi_loudness
```

<h1> Loudness </h1>
The construction work metaphor in the introduction of this portfolio sort of makes sense when looking at loudness. With violin plots; the thicness indicates how many tracks are at a specific point of the y-axis. At the thickest part of the 'blob' is where most of the tracks can be found. Sometimes, in the shape of a violin. In this case, it no such shape can be found. But to look at the harder styles. 4 of the harder styles can be found above the other harder genres. Having a slight advantage over dubstep and death metal. **Euphoric hardstyle and happy hardcore falling a bit short of the rest**. Generally can be said, harder styles definitely contain a strong loudness.

### It is happy of serious?
```{r}
combi_valence <- ggplot(combi) +
  geom_violin(aes(category, valence, fill = category))+
    labs(x = 'Genre', y = 'Valence') +
    ggtitle('Valence - music styles') +
  theme_hard; combi_valence
```

***

<h1> Valence </h1>
In general **harder styles music has a serious tone to it**. Especially hardcore genres (industrial, main, uptempo) seem to be more serious. An exeption seems to be **happy hardcore with a more valent tone**, which considering the name should not be a very big surprise. Hip hop and rock however seem to contain more valience. So, it looks like the hardcore compensates for the happy.

### Does it truly live up to it's fast reputation?
```{r}
combi_tempo <- ggplot(combi) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(category, tempo, fill = category))+
    labs(x = 'Genre', y = 'Tempo') +
    ggtitle('Tempo - music styles') +
  theme_hard; combi_tempo
```

***

<h1> Tempo </h1>
Strangely enough, harder styles music do **not seem to have an extravagrantly high tempo**. Which kind of were one of the predesignated criteria to determine wether it's harder styles music or not. Euphoric and raw hardstyle seem to have most of the tracks around the 150BMP and 160-165BMP mark respectively. This is in line with the **tendency for hardstyle producers to remain loyal to the 150-160BMP**. Surprisingly, uptempo seems to be at 100BMP, for which I have two hypothesis. First is Spotify tempo assesment spasses out, due to too high BPM or undefinable beat kicks. Second is there are often long breaks between drops in uptempo songs. It could be that a long break compensate for high BPM.

### How much energy goes in harder styles music?
```{r}
combi_energy <- ggplot(combi) +
  geom_violin(aes(category, energy, fill = category))+
    labs(x = 'Genre', y = 'Energy') +
    ggtitle('Energy - music Styles') +
  theme_hard; combi_energy
```

***

<h1> Energy </h1>
Energy seems more variable among the harder styles. With most genres having a great portion of it. Judging by the thickness of the plots for **mainstream hardcore, rawstyle and especially industrial seem on average to contain the most energy**. Comparible to death metal. The energy for happy hardcore and euphoric hardstyle seem more variable.

### What about keys?
```{r}
ggplot(
  harder_stylez,
  aes(x = key_name)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = mode_name), position='stack') +
  facet_wrap(~category)+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme_hard +
  labs(
    title = 'Harder styles genres and key',
    subtitle = 'Blue and red color determines the minor and major of the tone respectively',
    caption = 'Source: Spotify API'
  )
```
 
***
<h1> Why keys in harder styles don't work </h1>

It does seem that harder styles music in general does not remain loyal to one certain key. One explanation for that could be it is to refrain from being more repetative. For example the kick of hardstyle is pretty generalized. The variation possibility is limited so to create some additinal variability. There will be played with melodies a lot. 

Another point is that it might be useless to assign keys to harder styles music. Because it is digitally synthetised, audio comes from many different frequencies at once and are often distored and boosted. Despite there often being some kind of melody, a histogram of keys might not depict the information about the key we want.

The structural analysis will be done on two tracks. [maginary from Brennan Heart](https://open.spotify.com/track/2TgDK4TC5KsywTYafAE4Gd?si=nsg_V-X3Tmma2WOkdW9kMg) is truly a classic and is also a well defined euphoric hardstyle track. 

and [Life is Lost from Dr. Peacock and Sefa](https://open.spotify.com/track/2Tg6Lh9nlPbH8Qby1uHPeC?si=ZF7ENl4gRdGizzxHOFZsUw) characterizes itself as a true frenchcore track.

The first track is imaginary by Brennan Heart. This track has got 5 phases with repetition visible: 

intro - buildup - first drop - buildup - second drop

The buildup and drops are similar in structure, which is visible in the plot aswell.

The intro starts with singing, and a simple beat and melody. Timbre coëfficients c02, c04 and c06 are the strongest here.

Afterwards follows the buildup. The singing continues and additional melodies with increasing intensity join in. c03 and c05 join c02 with high intensity. c01 comes un in the background, which gives the listener the feel of a drop coming.

The drop. Most of the energy is put in c01 and c06. It seems that these could be the core of the hardstyle 'kick'.

The buildup and drop repeat with noticable differences.

```

The Life Is Lost track also has phases to be defined. 
Intro - First drop - Buildup - Drop - Pauze - Drop - Pauze - Drop - Outro

The track begins with atmospheric introduction (listen)

Without warning the track develops into the first drop. Just like the hardstyle track; ** the kick exists in the c01 coefficient**

Afterwards in settles down into a buildup phase. Moving along the melody and the story. Strong C02 and c03 activity. 

At the second drop, there is high c01 activity to be found. But it exists together with melodies.

The pauses are short and rich in c02 and c03.

The outro creates a transition to a piano play. Una mattina by Ludovico Enaudi, which, fun fact, is the sample Dr Peacock and Sefa used to create this track. It also gives you the opportunity to get down to earth and ask yourself 'what'd just happen?'

This track has much less buildup than the first track. The drops are longer and appear more frequently. One of the imporant differences between hardstyle and hardcore is highlighted here. **Hardcore drops are much less subtle and have less buildup than hardcore drops in general.** Also **hardcore drop are longer in duration than hardstyle drops**.

'HHC is definitely that bouncy, bubbly, piano-y, breakbeat-y, hip hop sampling, uber-cheesy, massively fun, whistle blowing, semi-spastic, candy raver sh*t.' 

'Happy Hardcore is major chord, piano-led, sample powered 90's rave.'

(Ultra)Violet {data-navmenu='Harder styles catalogue'.violet}
====================================

Column
-------

Euphoric Hardstyle


Column
------
Melodious, Emotional

This is considered the more approachable form of hardstyle. As opposed to raw hardstyle. This is a more melodic approach to hardstyle. The kick often moves in conjunction with the melody of the track making it very enjoyable to listen and dance to.

The sound first started in the early 2000s with influences from early hardcore and trance.

Some notable artists go under Headhunterz, Noisecontrollers, Wildstylez & Sub Zero Project.


Blue {data-navmenu='Harder styles catalogue'.blue}
====================================

Column
-------
Raw hardstyle


Column
------
Aggressive, dark melodies

In the early 2010s a demand for more harder kicks existed, rawstyle or raw-hardstyle was born. A more aggressive sound, darker melodies and harder bass. 

Rawstyle tracks have more drive to it, with shorter breaks. Rawstyle kicks tend to have a much harder transient with much distortion, granting it's aggressive nature. 

Some notable artists are: Radical Redemption, Warface, Rebellion, Gunz for Hire.


Black {data-navmenu='Harder styles catalogue'.black}
====================================

Column
-------

Mainstream Hardcore



Column
------

Distorted kicks.

Main hardcore is a style where the average artists and hardcore listerers can be found. One of the main distinguishable features from hardstyle is the higher tempo and its bass drum sound. Which essentially comes from take a normal synthesized bass drum and distorting it. This creates an agressive and loud sound as a result of the frequency spectrum spreading out. But it's not uncommon for the bass drum pattern to change pitch, therefore many tracks can still sound 'happy'. 

It started in the early 2000s as slower and more mature version of gabber. 

Artists worth mentioning are Angerfist, Miss K8, DJ Mad Dog

Silver {data-navmenu='Harder styles catalogue'.silver}
====================================
Column
-------

Industrial hardcore



Column
------

Industrial, Consistent

Industrial hardcore has many features of other genres. Mostly notable techno and gabber. What makes it unique from other harder styles is less breaks and more constant 'bonking'. 

Notable artists are The Outside Agency, Radium, N-Vitral.


Yellow {data-navmenu='Harder styles catalogue'.yellow}
====================================
Column
-------

Uptempo

Column
------

Explosive, fast

An umbrella term for again different genre's like frenchcore, terror and speedcore. But one thing that stands out from this style is the high tempo, energy and maddening chaos of the sound. Often very high and low pitch is found in each track and unexpected kickrolls are frequent. The explosive and fast nature make this style challenging to appreciate musically, but many tracks can actually be very melodious.

This style started in the early 1990s and has been consistendly (less) popular. Only in the latest few years the genres has been upcoming and popularised, very likely by the notable artists; Dr. Peacock, Sefa, Cyclone

Concluding remarks {.endpage}
===============================

Column {.white}
--------
In this portfolio an attempt was done to justify/classify popular subgenres in harder styles music. This music is considered to be EDM officially, stemming from influences of acid house in the late 80s. From then on out, there was constant evolution of the styles to where it stands today. 

In this branche of music there are plenty of ways to classify the harder styles music. While it is an option to classify the harder styles in many different genres, some just consider hardstyle and hardcore as the two main streams. It's not even a bad estimation if one were to consider tempo alone. However it doesn't matter if you refer to it as gabber / hardstyle / hardcore / death to my ears. I hope you learned something reading this portfolio or at least discouvered something in this overlooked corner of EDM. I certainly did.

I had fun putting together this portfolio and actually learned some usefull skills and facts, especially about music and data visualisation. Although I do feel that my final version has been very rushed, not even close to the version that I would have liked to hand in at the end of this course. This has mostly to do with my own work ethic and my fatal underestimation of the workload, not with the course, which I think was structured pretty well. I do expect this to influence my grade. I just think it needs to be said and that for the record I would not be surprised or annoyed if I need to redo the portfolio. Because I has a blast building it and doing it about my favorite music in the world.

Thank you for reading
